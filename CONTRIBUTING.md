# How to contribute with Accessibility for Devs?

Hello Dev! We would like to thank you in advance for your willingness to contribute. This project uses [Vuepress](vuepress.vuejs.org) and [Vue.js](vuejs.org) files for componentization. So, the content structure of this project is:

```sh
src/
---- README.md    # the website version in Portuguese
---- en/README.md # the same website version in English
---- .vuepress/   # vuepress folder with components, configurations and so on
```

There is a couple ways to contribute with this guide:

### Bug

Did you find a bug? Please submit a PR with correction or report as ISSUE.

For PR, create a new branch called `hotfix/<short-branch-name>` with the correction.

For ISSUE, don't forget the description of the bug and scenario to reproduce.

### Improvements

Did you see a content about Accessibility? Please submit a PR with a new branch called `feature/<short-branch-name>`. It's not necessary adding the new content in all translations.

### Review content

Did you find a error on content or a broken link? Please submit a PR with the correction. An another way to help us is with translations keep its in sync.

### New translation

Would you like a submit new translation? Follow the [Vuepress instructions for internacionalization](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/guide/i18n.html). Lastly, submit a PR with a new branch called `feature/<lang>-translation`, like `feature/zh-translation`.
